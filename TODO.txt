- Look into self-service or more automated user registration
    - could use a cron job
- Other features, like tmux/screen, chat, global leaderboards, etc.
- Think about other RLs to install - here's some ideas:
    - DoomRL / AliensRL
    - HyperRogue
    - Infra Arcana
- Optimization: at end of build, cleanup tmp files and uninstall unnecessary packages to save space
